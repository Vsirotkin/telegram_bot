# Telegram Bot Tests

This repository contains the test suite for a Telegram bot built using the `aiogram` library. The tests are designed to ensure the correct functionality of the bot's command handlers and other asynchronous operations.

## Overview

The test suite includes the following components:

- **Unit Tests**: These tests validate the individual functions and methods used in the bot's command handlers.
- **Mocking**: The tests use `AsyncMock` from the `unittest.mock` module to simulate the behavior of the `aiogram` library components.
- **Asyncio**: The tests are designed to work with asynchronous code, leveraging `pytest-asyncio` for managing async test functions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `pipenv` for managing dependencies
- `pytest` for running the tests
- `aiogram` library (latest version: 3.10.0)

To install the dependencies, run:

```sh
pipenv install
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
pipenv run pytest
```

This command will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and provide a summary of the test results.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized as follows:

- `tests/test_bot.py`: Contains the unit tests for the bot's command handlers.

Each test function is marked with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to indicate that it is an asynchronous test.

## Contributing

Contributions to the test suite are welcome! If you find any issues or want to add new tests, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

Please ensure that your changes do not break any existing tests and that new tests are well-documented.
